Hello!

This chatbot can collect new requirements for some features of a web conference tool.
It categorizes the requirements with the help of users and checks if the new requirement conflicts already existing ones.
In case a conflicts exists, the chatbot asks the user for information that might help to resolve this conflict.

A link to try out the chatbot was available during a test phase.
A screen recording of the chatbot will be available soon.
