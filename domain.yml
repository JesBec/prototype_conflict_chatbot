      It is necessary to categorize your feature to check if it is conflicting with other features.
      Here are all the categories with information about them:

      🎵 Audio:
      There are different options to share audio during a meeting: This could be your own voice or audio from screen or other sources.
      🎥 Video:
      Similar to audio, you can share a video of yourself or your screen from different sources.
      💻 Screen sharing:
      A web conference tool gives you the option to share your screen during a meeting. You could, e.g., show your desktop or an application.
      🎞 Recording:
      Sometimes it is useful to record the meeting to save it for later.
      😃 Reaction:
      Participants may want to react to something a presenter was saying and they can do so by choosing an emoji that will be displayed on their video.
      📊 Polling:
      Another way of getting feedback from participants of a meeting is polling.
      📄 Live transcript:
      Live transcripts can be enabled to help your participants better understand the presenter.
      💬 Chat:
      It can be helpful to share information not only by audio but also written via chat. This allows for private conversations during a meeting.
