            It is necessary to categorize your feature to check if it is conflicting with other features.
            Here are all the categories with information about them:

            🎵 Audio:
            There are different options to share audio during a meeting: This could be your own voice or audio from screen or other sources.
            🎥 Video:
            Similar to audio, you can share a video of yourself or your screen from different sources.
            💻 Screen sharing:
            A web conference tool gives you the option to share your screen during a meeting. You could, e.g., show your desktop or an application.
            🎞 Recording:
            Sometimes it is useful to record the meeting to save it for later.
            😃 Reaction:
            Participants may want to react to something a presenter was saying and they can do so by choosing an emoji that will be displayed on their video.
            📊 Polling:
            Another way of getting feedback from participants of a meeting is polling.
            📄 Live transcript:
            Live transcripts can be enabled to help your participants better understand the presenter.
            💬 Chat:
            It can be helpful to share information not only by audio but also written via chat. This allows for private conversations during a meeting.
