  utter_ask_more_information_categories_needed:

      It is necessary to categorize your requirement to check if it is conflicting with other requirement. Some requirements show the functionality of the system whereas others represent constraints. Otherwise, requirements in conflict cannot be implemented in the same system.\n
      Here are all the categories with information about them:\n\n
      🎵 Audio:\n
      There are different options to share audio during a meeting. This could be your own voice or audio from screen or other participants. This audio can also come from different sources such as a microphone from a webcam or smart phone or an application. So this category is about any audio you want to hear or share.\n
      🎥 Video:\n
      Similar to audio, you can share a video of yourself or your screen. This can involve different sources such as a camera from your webcam or an application on your screen. This category is about the video you want to share or want to see.\n
      💻 Screen sharing:\n
      A web conference tool gives you the option to share your screen. This category contains requirements that, for example, define how many users at a time and who can share their screen and what options they have.\n
      🎞 Recording:\n
      Sometimes it is useful to record the meeting to save it. Any restrictions to recording a meeting do also fall under this category.\n
      😃 Reaction:\n
      Participants may want to react to something a presenter was saying and they can do so by choosing an emoji that will be displayed on their video. This can lead to less interruption than having participants react via their microphones.\n
      📊 Polling:\n
      Another way of getting feedback from participants of a web conference is polling.\n
      📄 Live transcript:\n
      Live transcripts can be enabled to help your participants better understand the presenter.\n
      💬 Chat:\n
      It can be helpful to share information not only by audio but also written via chat. This offers the possibility to talk to the host or other participants privately.\n\n
      💡 Let me know when you are finished checking the categories.
